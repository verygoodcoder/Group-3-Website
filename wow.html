  <p style= "margin-bottom:20px;text-align:center; color:#676f9d;padding: 15px 750px 15px 35px;"><b>1. Monitor weather update:</b> Knowing about the typhoon can help you reduce its damage to your household. Thankfully, there are now more ways to see the weather forecast than tuning in on the TV for the news.</p>
   <p style= "margin-bottom:20px;text-align:center; color:#676f9d;padding: 15px 750px 15px 35px;"><b>2. Stock up on essential supplies:</b> You may get stuck at home for a while during a strong typhoon. And sometimes, local markets, grocery stores, and malls take a few days to re-open. To  keep the family fed, stock up on non-perishable, ready-to-eat food such as canned goods as well as drinking water. Don’t forget personal hygiene items and a first aid kit with essential medicine.

  <p style= "margin-bottom:20px;text-align:center; color:#676f9d;padding: 15px 750px 15px 35px;"><b>3. Know your community’s evacuation plan:</b> Barangay officials usually inform citizens of the evacuation process before a typhoon via public announcements, community meetings, or door-to-door visits. They should let you know about an early warning system, evacuation routes, and centers.</p>
    <p style= "margin-bottom:20px;text-align:center; color:#676f9d;padding: 15px 750px 15px 35px;"><b>4. Establish a family emergency plan:</b> Besides the community’s evacuation plan, it also helps to have a family emergency plan to ensure the safety of all family members.A good communication plan can keep you from getting separated during an evacuation. Make sure each family member has the others’ contact information. You should also list local authorities, hospitals, neighbors, and relatives in and out of town who can be contacted for assistance.</p>
     <p style= "margin-bottom:20px;text-align:center; color:#676f9d;padding: 15px 750px 15px 35px;"><b>5. Secure your home:</b> Check your home for repairs before the onset of a typhoon. Some of the parts you should check are your roof, gutters, downspouts, and the seals on your windows and doors.</p>
    <p style="text-align:center; color:#f9b17a;padding: 15px 750px 15px 35px;"><b>To mitigate the impacts of typhoons, it is essenential that we follow the following steps above. A family emergency plan, with designated meeting spots, shared contact info, and a list of emergency contacts are vital for everyone's safety during disasters like typhoons.
